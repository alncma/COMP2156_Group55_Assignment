Automation DevOps is about automation of manual tasks in the software development life cycle – from code deployment to testing to provisioning of infrastructure – the more tasks that can be automated, the more efficient, consistent and reliable engineers are in delivering the software. After learning DevOps tools and practices, tasks that used to require human effort can be automated.

CI pipelines allow engineers to frequently integrate code back into a common repository, and deploy applications to production environments after passing through predefined stages of automated and manual testing. Through exposure to CI/CD best practices, engineers can move from a low-frequency, high risk and error-prone release cycle to a rapid pace of shipment that will get features into the hands of end users more quickly.

by sharing the underlying DevOps principles and best practices and showing the value of DevOps methodologies, you’ll help teams collaborate more effectively across roles – especially collaboration between development and operations teams, and with other cross-functional teams – and work together to resolve problems and work more efficiently to deliver software that meets the needs of your customer.
